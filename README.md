# Chatbot Using AI & ML

A mini-project report submitted to JNTU Hyderabad in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree **Bachelor of Technology** in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a chatbot using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Chatbots have become increasingly popular in various industries for their ability to automate conversations and assist users by providing quick and accurate responses. This project aims to provide an AI-powered chatbot that can understand and respond to users' frequently asked questions using deep learning algorithms.

## System Analysis

### Existing System

Traditional chatbots typically rely on predefined rules and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which limit their ability to handle complex user queries. They often struggle with understanding context and maintaining coherent conversations, resulting in user frustration.

### Proposed System

Our proposed chatbot system uses deep learning and NLP to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. The system is built using Python and deep learning models trained on extensive datasets of potential questions and answers. Key advantages include:

- Improved accuracy and contextual understanding.
- Ability to learn and adapt over time.
- Reduced manpower for customer support.

## System Design

The system consists of the following modules:

**Chatbot Interface:** Facilitates user interaction with the chatbot.

### System Architecture

The system architecture consists of a deep learning model trained with relevant data. The chatbot uses NLP to process user input and generate responses based on the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for building the chatbot.
- **Django**: Python web server framework.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: To process and understand user input.
- **Deep Learning**: Used to train the chatbot model for accurate responses.

### Web Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX
- **Backend**: Python (Django)

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Django
   - MySQL

2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up the MySQL database and update the database configuration in the Django settings.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Migrate the database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Start the Django server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

## Usage

1. **Registration**:
   - New users can register via the registration page.
2. **Login**:
   - Registered users can log in to interact with the chatbot.
3. **Chatbot Interaction**:
   - Ask questions and receive responses from the chatbot in real-time.

## Results

The chatbot accurately answers user queries based on the trained deep learning model. It effectively handles a range of questions within its trained scope and demonstrates the potential of AI and ML in automating conversational interfaces.

## Conclusion and Future Enhancements

The project demonstrates the potential of AI and ML in developing effective chatbot systems. Future enhancements may include:

- **Multimodal Interaction**: Integrating text, voice, and other input methods.
- **Context Awareness**: Enhancing the chatbot's ability to understand context over multiple interactions.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Detecting and responding to user emotions for a more engaging experience.
